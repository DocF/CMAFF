## Abstract
Cross-modality fusing complementary information of multispectral remote sensing image pairs can improve the perception ability of detection algorithms, making them more robust and reliable for a wider range of applications, such as nighttime detection. Compared with prior methods, we think different features should be processed specifically, the modality-specific features should be retained and enhanced, while the modality-shared features should be cherry- picked from the RGB and thermal IR modalities. Following this idea, a novel and lightweight multispectral feature fusion approach with joint common-modality and differential-modality attentions are proposed, named Cross-Modality Attentive Feature Fusion (CMAFF). Given the intermediate feature maps of RGB and IR images, our module parallel infers attention maps from two separate modalities, common- and differential-modality, then the attention maps are multiplied to the input feature map respectively for adaptive feature enhancement or selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach can achieve the state-of-the-art performance at a low computation cost.
